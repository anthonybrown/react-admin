#react-admin

This is my implementation of the (Pluarlsight, Building Applications with React and Flux)[https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-flux-building-applications] course, by Cory House, excellent course.

Using ES5 with the createClass syntax
Using hard coded API instead of a real API
using a database to store and update data.

To run, clone and cd into directory
    `npm i`
then run gulp
    `gulp`

###Todo's
- [ ] Use lastest versions of React and React-Router (of course React-dom will be used)
- [ ] Use a real datastore, probably Firebase
- [ ] Update from ES5 to ES6
